# IFTR_MobileApp
A mobile app I created at university. Its a information app about theme parks around the UK. 

The application was made using android studio using firebase in the backend to store information about theme parks such as: 
Contact Information, park ratings, rides, ticket prices.

The database also stores user information as the user has to sign up and login to access the app. Firebase authentication is use for this.

Functionality:
-Signup
-login
-update user information including profile picture
-google maps api to sjpw park locations
-search for parks
-News api ( Just a template as i could not find any news api's for themeparks)
-shows rides and park information
-users can rate and review each park
-users can buy tickets and view all orders
-users can rate and review parks and view all reviews from their profile
-users can delete their account.
